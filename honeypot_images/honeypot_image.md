# Notes on honeypot images

This folder contains the generated images, as well as the base image that is

Currently PiPot makes use of [Minibian](https://minibianpi.wordpress.com/), 
which is an optimized Raspbian install with minimal dependencies. This allows
for a small download size and small maintenance cost.

Currently upon install, the next version is downloaded: [2016-03-12 (Jessie)]
